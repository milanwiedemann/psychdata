# psychdata
psychdata: An R package for common data manipulation of psychological datasets

## Installation

First, you need to install the devtools package to download the `suddengains` package from this GitHub repository.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

To install the current stable version of `psychdata` package:

```r
devtools::install_github(repo = "milanwiedemann/psychdata")
```

## Ideas
- build this package on base R, tidyverse and psych functions
- focus on functions that are easily available in SPSS but require some programming in R
- provide simulated datasets for illustration (functions of this package and other packages)
