psychdata: An R package for common data manipulation of psychological datasets

- build this package on base R, tidyverse and psych functions
- focus on functions that are easily available in SPSS but require some programming in R
- provide simulated datasets for illustration (functions of this package and other packages)
- add all the helper functions I wrote for different projects e.g.
  - sum.x(), mean.x
  - automatic, consistent renaming ...
